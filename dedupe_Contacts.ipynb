    "# Dedupe Contacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Contacts need to be uploaded into NB\n",
    "\n",
    "The data extract from CiviCRM is producing duplicate Contacts records on `Primary Email` field. Further, these duplicate records are recorded as having unique Contact ID's. Also, there are secondary Email fields that can be the same as the same record's `Primary Email`, or even *another record's* `Primary Email`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't have contacts with same email in NB so we need to clean these up to ensure that all unique contacts also have unique primary emails\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "*TBC*\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Email field will define the 'uniqueness' of a contact. Because these have a potential one to many relationship with Contact ID's we need to decide which Contact ID to 'keep'. Which Contact ID to keep will also have an impact to other relationships in the database e.g., Members, Member relationships, Contributions ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the user is simply prompted to keep the first or last record in a set with the same Primary Email field. the associated record and its Contact ID is then kept. The rest (which have the same Primary Email but different Contact ID) are written to a separate file for safe keeping - and potentially future followup. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Order of Ops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Identify ALL records duplicated on [Contact ID] but do not remove :  \n",
    "- generate an output file of these records`file_dupeContactIDRecords` - investigate why and what to do with them and for safe keeping\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Remove all records that have blank [Primary Email] fields\n",
    "- generate an output file of these records `file_blankRecords` - for safe keeping\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Remove records that have the same `dedupeField`, keeping only the first (or as defined by user)\n",
    "- generate an output file of the discarded records `file_dupeRecords` - for safe keeping and potential future followup\n",
    "- generate an output file of the remaining records `file_withoutDupes` - this is the file that gets loaded into NB\n"
